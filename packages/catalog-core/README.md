# catalog-core

`catalog-core` is the shared consistency layer for every CatalogKit module.

It owns:

- artifact schema versioning
- canonical ID normalization
- shared graph models
- deterministic JSON serialization
- merge semantics

It does **not** perform extraction by itself. Tool packages such as `query-map`
depend on `catalog-core` and emit artifacts that follow its contract.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install catalog-core
```

For local development:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,release]"
```

## Contract

The source of truth for the shared artifact contract is
[`docs/contract.md`](docs/contract.md).
