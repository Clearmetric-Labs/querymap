"""
Compare hand-derived value-lineage counts to per-model counts in expected.yaml.

THIS SCRIPT IS NOT CI SOURCE OF TRUTH.

It compares value_lineage_expected.yml (hand oracle) against per-model edge counts
read from expected.yaml — a snapshot of past engine output. If the live engine
drifts from its own snapshot, this script can still report green while the engine
is wrong.

For live validation, run:
  pytest tests/test_value_lineage_oracle.py
